# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I started to learn computer programming in the spring of 2020 to upskill myself and learn something new. Originally starting with a Udemy course on Java, I quickly signed up to a coding bootcamp with General Assembly. 

As you can see with by GitHub stats below, my learning hasn't stopped (and probably never will ðŸ¤“) as I've looked into many languages and frameworks.

If you see that I've written dirty code or I've done something completely wrong, please please let me know!

I'm currently seeking my first role in the industry so any tips would be greatly appreciated. ðŸš€
